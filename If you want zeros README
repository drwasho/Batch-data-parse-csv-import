If you'd like to keep the zeros from your imported data (instead of dashes or whatever), follow these instructions:

Add this underneath "# use the unix command cut for this"  in mergeorama.sh

  # convert dashes back to zero
  perl -pi -e 's/-/0/g' ../output.csv 

----------------------------------------

If it isn't working, make sure you've emptied out the files in the data folder, which may contain the remnants of earlier attempts to parse the data.
