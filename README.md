Batch-data-parse-csv-import
===========================

This script is used to parse multiple data files (with the same x column values, different y column values) into one csv file that can be easily imported into excel or graphpad. Originally developed for data created by SPCImage, but will work for any .asc file (or anything with a few edits).
